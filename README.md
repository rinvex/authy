## Usage

Usage is pretty easy and straightforward:

### Prepare requirements

```php
$apiKey = 'AuthySecretKey';
$httpClient = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
```

> **Note:** make sure to replace `AuthySecretKey` with your secret key from the installation steps.

### Authy App

Create a new Authy app instance and interact with it:

```php
$authyApp = new \Rinvex\Authy\App($httpClient, $apiKey);

$appStats = $authyApp->stats(); // Get app stats
$appDetails = $authyApp->details(); // Get app details
```

### Authy User

Create a new Authy user instance and interact with it:

```php
$authyUser = new \Rinvex\Authy\User($httpClient, $apiKey);

$user = $authyUser->register('user@domain.com', '317-338-9302', '54'); // Register user
$userActivity = $authyUser->registerActivity($user->get('user')['id'], 'cookie_login', 'Test Data'); // Register user activity
$userStatus = $authyUser->status($user->get('user')['id']); // Get user status
$userDeleted = $authyUser->delete($user->get('user')['id']); // Delete user
```

### Authy Token

Create a new Authy token instance and interact with it:

```php
$authyToken = new \Rinvex\Authy\Token($httpClient, $apiKey);

$smsTokenSent = $authyToken->send($user->get('user')['id'], 'sms'); // Send SMS token
$callTokenStarted = $authyToken->send($user->get('user')['id'], 'call'); // Start automated call
$tokenVerified = $authyToken->verify(54321, $user->get('user')['id']); // Verify token
```

### Intuitive Responses

Work Intuitively with Authy responses:

```php
$body = $tokenVerified->body(); // Get all response body
$code = $tokenVerified->statusCode(); // Get response status code
$succeed = $tokenVerified->succeed(); // Check whether respose is a success
$failed = $tokenVerified->failed(); // Check whether respose is a failure
$message = $tokenVerified->message(); // Get response message
$item = $tokenVerified->get('item'); // Get response body item
$errors = $tokenVerified->errors(); // Get response errors
```

> **Note:** All authy requests return authy response, with a unified interface for your convenience, so you can interact with all responses the same way as above.


## Installation

1. Install the package via composer:
    ```shell
    composer require rinvex/authy
    ```

2. If you haven't already: Register an [Authy](https://www.authy.com) account -> Sign in -> Access [dashboard](https://dashboard.authy.com) -> Create new application -> Copy your API Secret key

3. Done! You can refer to [Usage](#usage) again.
